# Lisp excercise - FlatMap.

* Write a map funciton which runs through a list and copies it
into a new list. But while copying, it does something to the data.

* Write a flat function.The function should take a list (that contains other lists)
 as input and return a single, flattened, list as output.
 
* Combine the two functions.
